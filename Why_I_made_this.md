What I found interesting was him using is code towards the end and "playing" a decryption game. 
This got me thinking to create my own version of this, in C++, and (possibly) create a discord bot to 
go with this.

For the main code, I used BK's code as structure inspiration, then did my own coding to get it how I wanted it to. As for the
This code takes in the file, grabs a key and paragraph, then displays the "game" similar to BK's decryption.

Plans for the discord bot include taking various moments from films & games, generate an encrypted text file,
along with a key, which will then be read into the program listed above.
